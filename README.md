# Affective Computing final project: Deepface Moodtracker

## Setup
Before getting into the engine there's two scripts we need to have running in terminal:
1. **apy.py** python script inside the deepface/api/src directory(not in the repo)
2. **camera_stream.py** inside the python directory(inside the repo)

## Running the app
Starting the app is as simple as pressing the play button on the top right

## Editing the code
Code can be edited directly in the godot editor, you can open the text editor by either clicking the script button on the top center
